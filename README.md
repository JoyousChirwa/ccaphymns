">Hymn app</h1>

As it says aove ths app containes hymns but streamlined to the specifics of one Church denomination of CCAP. The hymns still apply to multiple Church denomnations since the Hymns are basically the same. 

This app is a localized web application using HTML and Javascript for rendering the content of the application which are Church Hymns.

Java code for initiating the web view. Html,  Javascript, and css assets are liked to the WebView itself.

The NoActionbar style is used to take the focus away from the default android app feel and let the WebView handle all aspects of the app.

This App is a work in progress.
